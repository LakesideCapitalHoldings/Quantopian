Quantiopian Program for LSCH Readme:
Program.py is the python program that contains the code.
For running backtests copy your code into Quantopian and run the back test; record the backtest in the "backtest" wiki page
Basic Rules:
  -Only edit on the "master" branch if you are making a simple code fix, bug fix, or any other simple edit.
  -Otherwise editing on the "testing" branch, or ask to create a new branch with your tests on it
  -Changes to the main function of the algorithm must be documented in the wiki, the "algorithm" page.
  -For now limit changes of the algorithm to any previously discussed change, unless editing on one of the testing branches
  -Document EVERY change, a couple of words will do, such as "deleted if...then statment" or "added new method to handle data"
